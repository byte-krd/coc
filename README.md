 - Accepting constructive criticism graciously
 
Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

 - Sexual language and imagery in any event venue, including talks
 - Violent threats or language directed against another person
 - Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
 - Insults or put-downs, or bullying
 - Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
 - Unwelcome sexual attention or advances

 - Sustained disruption of talks or other activities
 - Sharing explicit content in any form (links, images, gif...etc)
 
Participants asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately.
